# Swap the Drop

[Swap the Drop](http://static.echonest.com/SwapTheDrop/index.html "") is a web app that lets you play with your music. 

It uses The Echo Nest API to analyze a set of tracks and break them down into bars, beats, tatums, and then uses this data to create an
interactive visualization of the songs. You can then interact with the songs in all sorts of  ways.
